AI Research Assistant - Automated Research Pipeline
📌 Project Overview
This AI-powered research assistant automates the process of idea generation, validation, ranking, and refinement. It leverages RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with LLMs to systematically evaluate and enhance research ideas based on structured criteria.

🔧 Features
✅ Automated Idea Generation - Generates research ideas based on user queries
✅ Validation & Assessment - Evaluates the relevance and feasibility of ideas
✅ Ranking & Refinement - Assigns scores to ideas and suggests improvements
✅ Iterative Research Enhancement - Implements refinements and re-ranks ideas

To run :
python run_demo.py

🛠 How It Works?
1️⃣ Idea Generation - The AI generates multiple research ideas based on user queries
2️⃣ Validation & Assessment - Evaluates each idea's relevance and feasibility
3️⃣ Ranking & Refinement - Scores ideas and suggests improvements
4️⃣ Final Output - Presents refined research ideas with detailed rankings

📢 Future Improvements
🔹 Expand to more research domains
🔹 Implement self-learning ranking models
🔹 Provide real-time feedback to users
